This study investigates whether COVID-19 sentiment, as extracted from USA-located tweets, can be used to predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index. 
Recent sentiment analysis techniques have shown us that the DJIA daily up and down moves can be predicted with an accuracy of about 87% based on the overall mood on Twitter. 
Does this also apply to a certain event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic? 
Based on the text data of about 1.3 million USA-located Tweets from the period February 2020 â€“ May 2020, 
I analyze the sentiment of the text by using the AFINN Lexicon, VADER, and a Neurel Network, 
assigning a sentiment score, and using this to predict the Dow Jones Industrial Average Index.
